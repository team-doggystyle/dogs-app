This is a web development project by Anna Khardina, Daniel Owens, Kendra Weinisch, and Joey Kim for the UC Berkeley Full Stack Web Development program in Q2 2018.

 

We wanted to remake the website of a respected non-profit charity whose web presence was not as successful as they had hoped. We chose a dog rescue in San Bernardino county whose site was very basic: Cause for San Bernardino Paws. It had multiple links competing for the viewer’s attention, making it busy and counterintuitive. We wanted to clean up the site and refocus the attention on the rescue’s main initiatives: adoption and donation for a new shelter facility.

 

Our project fulfills the following class requirements:

 

Use a Node and Express Web Server;

Be backed by a MySQL Database an ORM (not necessarily Sequelize);

Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data;

Be deployed using Heroku (with Data);

Utilize at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed;

Have a polished frontend / UI;

Have folder structure that meets MVC Paradigm;

Meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming).

Must not expose sensitive API key information on the server, see Protecting-API-Keys-In-Node.md

 

We even managed to include some of the bonus qualities:

 

Incorporate Basic Testing Framework, see Project Suggestions;

Use Handlebars for Server-Side Templating

Incorporate Authentication (JSON Web Tokens, Sessions, Etc.)

Use an existing public dataset to power the database

Work as a group in github
