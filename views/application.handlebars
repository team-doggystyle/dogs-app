            <span class="attn">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE APPLYING.</span>
            <span>If you are applying for multiple dogs at multiple rescues, we ask that you not apply for a Cause dog yet. We
                are small and foster based and rescue on the side. When we work to coordinate home checks and then a potential
                adopter adopts another dog in the meantime, it is very hard on us. Please apply when you are 100% interested
                in one of our dogs so we do not invest time into the adoption process with you. Please also always have the
                courtesy to let us know if you adopted another dog in the meantime after applying.</span>
            <span>Also understand rescued pets often come from neglectful, abusive, or otherwise substandard situations, so please
                understand many of our available dogs may need basic training, have poor indoor manners (as they lived outside
                most of their lives), may require potty training, etc. We work with them as much as possible with trainers
                as well as in our homes during the foster period to ensure they are adoptable. No dog is ever "perfect,"
                although we think they all are, but a rescued dog can come with emotional baggage that not everyone is ready
                to handle. They may take longer to bond with you and trust you. They may have separation anxiety, and scratch
                at your doors and eat your shoes when left alone. They say dogs only live in the "now," but some of our dogs
                are more sensitive than others, and have lasting idiosyncrasies that require a patient, loving and understanding
                human. So please make sure you are ready to embark on one of the most fulfilling and challenging adventures
                ever - rescuing a dog. If you are, you will find yourself being "rescued" just as much as the baby you are
                rescuing. </span>
