            <p>Owning a pet is a lifelong commitment. Rescued pets often come from neglectful, abusive, or otherwise substandard
                situations, so please understand many of our available dogs may need basic training, have poor indoor manners
                (as they lived outside most of their lives), may require potty training, etc. They may take longer to bond
                with you and trust you. They may have separation anxiety, scratch at your doors, eat your shoes when left
                alone, and more. They say dogs only live in the "now," but some of our dogs are more sensitive than others
                and have lasting idiosyncrasies that require a patient, loving, and understanding human. We work with them
                as much as possible with trainers as well as in our homes to ensure they are adoptable. No dog is ever "perfect,"
                although WE think they all are, but a rescued dog can come with emotional baggage that not everyone is ready
                to handle.</p>
